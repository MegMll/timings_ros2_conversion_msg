Benchmark for Conversion Message in Ros2
===

## Summary
This repository provides a benchmark to compare the performance of message conversion nodes in ROS 2 implemented in both C++ and Python. The goal is to evaluate the time it takes to process messages in each language and identify performance differences that may influence the choice of implementation for specific use cases in robotic systems.

## Dependencies
To make this work you'll need to have installed [ros_interface_mpc](https://github.com/edantec/ros_interface_mpc) as well as ros2 and Eigen.
